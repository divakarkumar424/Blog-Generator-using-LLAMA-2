Meta has unveiled the latest version of its popular language model, Llama. Called Llama 2, the model is now free for businesses to adopt, customize and monetize

Llama 2 comes in three model sizes â€“ seven billion parameters, 13 billion parameters and 70 billion parameters â€“ and is open source, meaning itâ€™s available for research and commercial use. Also available are versions focused on chat applications.

Meta has also released the model weights and starting code for both the pretrained and conversational fine-tuned versions of Llama 2. Users can request access here; the model is also available via Hugging Face.

We are going to develop a Blog Generator, which is a platform that automates the process of creating blogs. In most cases, it allows users to create blog posts, manage content, and customize the design and layout of their blogs
